# Brainstorming ideas for AT3

## Idea 1: Inner group social platform
- Xbox friend group and Our Class
A platform where you can talk to eachother or host events within a small group where everyone already knows eachother.

Interesting Register: Would be conceptually engaging focusing on niche social dynamics and discovering what digital interaction looks like when it's not optimised for mass networking, instead to build on and strengthen closer existing connections
## Build upon music visualisers to make an app
- Music Community
Create an app that allows users to upliad their own music and create more unique visualiser effects or their own music videos generatively

Interesting Register: It's interesting to visualise how an algorithm can interpret sound and display that visually, and to ask the question "what does it mean to experience music" 

## Forza horizon Tuning helper
- Forza Horizon Tuning
Read forza's Data out to display telemetry on a seperate screen

Interesting Register: Intillectually stimulating interface for the viewer to decode a complex system.
