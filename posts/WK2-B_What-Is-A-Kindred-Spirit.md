# What is a ‘kindred spirit’?
I feel like the logical place to start would be asking old Google for a definition. According to the typical definition, a kindred spirit is basically _“a person whose interests or attitudes are similar to one’s own.”_ A person. With similar interests. Sounds straightforward enough, right? If you like the nerdy comfort watching Star Trek or get too engulfed in midnight coding sessions, boom, kindred spirits!  

But that definition feels a bit dry, doesn’t it? Kindred spirits are _supposed_ to be about an almost mystical connection, like your soul recognises a familiar soul in someone else. The phrase itself literally breaks down into **“kindred”** (meaning _family, of the same kind_) and **“spirit”** (meaning _soul or essence_). So a kindred spirit is basically a **soul sibling**. It’s that person you meet and _instantly_ vibe with, as if you’ve known them forever even if you just met. It’s less about matching favourite movies and more about an unspoken understanding.  

Now, traditionally this concept is reserved for people. Think of best friends in TV shows (Jake and Finn from Adventure time) or that feeling when you meet someone and within five minutes you’re finishing each other’s sentences. It’s **chemistry** on a soul level. You just “get” each other without needing to explain why you alphabetise your bookshelf or why a certain song makes you cry happy tears.

But… what if your kindred spirit isn’t a person at all? I would like to demonstrate that the whole _feeling of deep connection_ can extend into more abstract territory: into the stories we consume, the games we play, the places we inhabit, even the very cosmos we live in. If a **kindred spirit** means a soul that _feels like home_, then who’s to say a **TV show**, a **video game**, or space itself can’t fit that definition in some way? I certainly think they can.  

**Post-publishing note**: I realise i had way too much fun making this blog post and went off on a huge tangent describing what a kindred spirit is... Now's your chance to skip to where i actually do the homework. Look for the header "So much for succinct". It's about 3 headers down from here.
# Kindred Spirits in Fiction
Some of the most profound _kindred_ connections I’ve felt have been with fictional worlds and characters. Case in point: I consider two of my all-time favorite animated shows, **Arcane** and **Avatar: The Last Airbender**, to be kindred spirits of mine. Yeah, I know they’re not _people_, but hear me out. These shows resonated with me so deeply that it’s like they reached out from the screen, gave me a hug, and said, _“I understand you”.  

Take **Arcane**, for example.

I'll admit it, i saw that it was a League of Legends thing and i wanted nothing to do with it, but everyone kept talking about it and telling me to watch it, so i did. I was instantly blown away, seeing pieces of myself in the characters and the struggles they faced. The show was dripping with emotional depth and i just couldn't stop watching. There were moments I caught myself nodding along or even tearing up because something on-screen mirrored an experience or feeling in my own life. The artistry in Arcane (i mean paint-like visuals where every frame is an art piece, and an amazing score), it truly stirred my soul. I’d pause an episode after an emotional scene and just… _feel_. It was as if the creators peeked into the collective unconscious of people like me and said, “Let’s make a story that speaks to *that*”. Arcane became more than just a show I liked; it felt like a friend that _truly got me_.  

Similarly, **Avatar: The Last Airbender** has been a show i hold close to my heart for *years*. 
![Avatar](Wk-2B/ATLA.jpg)  
On the surface, it’s a kids’ show about a fun-loving Airbender and his friends saving the world. But anyone who’s watched it knows it carries wisdom that sticks with you well into adulthood. I’ve rewatched Avatar and found that it _still_ speaks to me, perhaps even more now than when I was a kid. The characters feel like lifelong friends. Aang’s hopeful spirit and search for balance, Zuko’s redemption arc, and Uncle Iroh’s gentle wisdom and humanity, all of it hits a very tender spot in my heart. There’s an episode where Iroh sings softly to commemorate his son, and every time I see it or listen to the song, I’m a puddle of tears. Why? Because it taps into real feelings of grief, love, and healing. It’s like the show knows me and is gently saying, _“I’ve been there too.”_ The whole journey of Avatar, with its humor, heart, and profound lessons about fate and choice, feels like talking to an old mentor. It’s comfort and inspiration wrapped in a colourful adventure.  

I think what Arcane, Avatar, and stories like these prove is that sometimes a fictional narrative can resonate with your inner self just as strongly as a real person can. You find bits of your own spirit reflected back through characters and storytelling. When I finished these series, I had that bittersweet feeling of saying goodbye to a friend - you know it’s the end of the journey, and you’re happy yet sad because it meant so much to you. That feeling of connection is the kindred spirit effect. It goes beyond just “I enjoyed this story”; it’s more like “This story is a part of me now”.  

# Outer Wilds

Moving from TV to games, let’s talk about **Outer Wilds** – a video game that, to me, is basically a kindred spirit hidden inside a cleverly designed interactive experience. If you haven’t played it, Outer Wilds is a game about space exploration, ancient mysteries, and a 22-minute time loop that resets every time the sun goes supernova (yes, it’s as wild as it sounds). But beyond the cool sci-fi premise, this game made me _feel_ things I didn’t expect a game could make me feel. It’s not just entertainment; it’s an emotional journey, almost a philosophical one. I seriously could not recommend it more.

<small>plus you get to roast marshmallows over campfires</small>

It's set in a tiny solar system, you're a tiny astronaut on a tiny planet, you hop in a rickety wooden spaceship, and launch yourself into the aforementioned solar system armed with nothing but your own curiosity and a scouting device. There’s no combat, no levelling up, just you, your wits, and the quiet haunting beauty of space. I remember finding an old banjo tune being transmitted from somewhere in space, and I followed it to find a fellow traveler around a campfire on a distant planet, playing music under the dead black sky, littered with specs of stars. I sat next to the campfire and began roasting marshmallows and In that moment, I felt an overwhelming sense of peace and connection. Here I was, a player on Earth, connecting with a fictional alien character through a simple campfire song in a game. It was profound, and looking back on it now, it's become a piece of me.  

As i played more of the game, i translated messages left by an ancient race and pieced together the fate of the universe, and I realised the game was quietly teaching me about life and loss. Each loop I experienced the end of the world, and each time I was sent back to try again, the only thing that ever changed was how much i knew (remember, no progression). There’s something poetic and heartbreaking about that cycle, learning to let go, learning to persevere, and ultimately making peace with an ending. When I finally reached the end of Outer Wilds (no spoilers here, its for you to experience for yourself if you so choose), I was hit with a wave of emotions. I sat there, staring at the credits, feeling like I just had a soul-to-soul conversation with the universe, It was that powerful. I wasn’t sad in the typical “oh no it’s over” way; I was **moved** - the kind of deep, resonant feeling you get after finishing a great book or after a long cathartic talk with a dear friend. I realised that Outer Wilds had become more than a favourite game; it felt like a wise, empathetic companion that had guided me through a miniature lifetime of experiences in its world. A true kindred spirit, if ever a game could be one.  

I know it might sound bizarre to label a _video game_ as a spirit kindred to my own. But Outer Wilds genuinely gave me that intuitive _click_. It’s like the developers bottled up a particular curiosity, the feeling of gazing at the night sky and contemplating your place in it, and handed it to us in the form of a game. And that feeling resonated with me completely. I’ll often listen to the game’s soundtrack (i'm listening to it right now. it's _gorgeous_, by the way) and instantly I’m back in that mindset, like I’m reconnecting with an old friend. Space can feel cold and empty, but Outer Wilds made space feel like home. That’s something special.  
# Inanimate, but Intimate

So how about finding a kindred spirit in **music**, or even in **spacetime itself**? Abstract enough for you? These are the quiet, often overlooked kind of connections that sneak up on you. They don’t come with faces or names, but they can wrap around your heart just the same.  

**Music** is probably the easiest of the three to relate to. Have you ever heard a song and felt, _“This song understands me. This melody is speaking to my soul.”_? It’s a cliché, sure, but it happens! I’ll be minding my own business, maybe feeling a bit melancholic on a Sunday afternoon, and then a certain song comes on (maybe one of those tracks I haven’t heard in years). Suddenly I’m overwhelmed with nostalgia and comfort, as if an old friend just dropped by to pat me on the back. Music has this uncanny ability to capture emotions and moments in time. A gentle piano piece or a lyrical song can resonate with whatever mood or thought you can’t express in words. In those moments, the music is a kindred spirit. It doesn’t judge or demand; it just _echoes_ what’s already inside me.  

Let’s go **full abstract**: finding a kindred spirit in **spacetime itself**. By spacetime, I mean the universe, the flow of time, existence. This one’s a bit challenging to articulate. I’ve always been a bit of a space nerd, fascinated by space and stars, and i could never get enough of Captain Picard in the starship Enterprise. When I look up at a clear night sky, I get this feeling in my chest, like I’m looking at an old friend. Carl Sagan famously said _“We are made of star-stuff”_, and maybe that’s the source of this feeling; on a fundamental level, I’m literally connected to the universe. Sometimes when I’m restless or feeling insignificant, I’ll start reading about physics or watching videos about how time is relative, how spacetime can bend, etc. It’s like the **physics** of reality are a grand story, and knowing that story makes me feel less alone. I catch myself thinking: _“Wow, time is this thing we all travel through together, and the fabric of space is something we’re all woven into. I’m a part of something so immense and old, yet here I am, a tiny conscious blip marvelling at it, along with quite literally everyone else”_ In those moments, there’s a real sense of companionship with existence itself. It’s as if spacetime is a patient friend, silently accompanying me through every second of my life - I’m part of the universe and it’s part of me. A kindred spirit doesn’t have to share your hobbies; sometimes it’s enough that it shares your atoms and your journey through time. A kindred spirit can be anything you feel attached to, doesn't matter how abstract or weird it is.

# So much for succinct.
Maybe off track, but now that i've **comfortably** demonstrated what a kindred spirit is, i can talk about my chosen kindred spirit.  

**Context**
Remember Outer Wilds? i don't blame you if you didn't read through the whole blog post, but it's a game i feel very connected to. Adjacent to the main storyline of the game is a mini-game that i think just brings the whole experience together. The minigame in question would be the campfire marshmallow roasting minigame. 

**Common Purpose / challenge**
I have distinct childhood memories of camping with dad, specifically at night, when all the stars are out unobstructed by light pollution. I remember we would light a small campfire and roast oversized marshmallows over it (i also remember the seemingly guided smoke that constantly went for my eyes), and accompanied by the soft and creamy insides of the marshmallow, you could tilt your head back slightly and just stare into the cosmos. I havent been camping in years, and without anything to bring me back that memory, i would surely have forgotten it.

But playing outer wilds for the first time and sitting near that campfire, roasting a marshmallow, brought that memory back to me and helped it burn on inside my mind. It's that little bit of childhood memory that i wont let go away, and this digital campfire has helped me with that. My goal is to create a Lo-fi version of that marshmallow roasting experience, and create my own experience engine.

# Visual, Sonic and Interactive elements
**Visual**
My sketch will include a simple particle simulation of a campfire and a marshmallow that follows the cursor, which can roast to any level of perfection the user prefers. The visuals will be simple and as mentioned Lo-fi, which means very little visual clutter aside from the elements i want to highlight, being the marshmallow and campfire.

**Sonic**
Basic sonic elements following the guides i set out for myself in Week 3a's post, where they exist mainly as complimentary to the visual and interactive elements of the sketch, like calm campfire music, the soft sizzling of the campfire, etc.

**Interaction**
The limits of this sketches interaction will be basic and will work together with sound to compliment the visuals. To me, that means everything will be freeform, allowing the user to do whatever they want and having complete control over the program, with no outset goals or objectives for them to complete.
