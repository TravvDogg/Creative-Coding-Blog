This week, i'm looking at another of [Rafaël Rozendaal's online works](https://www.newrafael.com/internet/), and breaking it's **Visual, Sonic** and **Interactive** elements to examine how it achieves the 'Cute' aesthetic register in these three categories.
# Rafaël Rozendaal: Reflection
His artwork represents two gradients growing in size, interacting with each other until they cover the entire screen. The simulation is constantly evolving, with the gradients starting from scratch once in a while, only to grow and fill the entire screen again.

Like a lot of his constantly repeating work, i get a sense of constant growth from it, with varying levels of unease, but i recently came across a video that perfectly mimics the feeling, but with sound
<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%;">
  <iframe style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BzNzgsAE4F0" title="Shepard Tone" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

It has the same theme of constant growth and makes me feel the same way as some of his other pieces. This one feels similar, but with less of a sense of unease, and instead more of a funky kind of artistic beauty that i could say is cute, in contrast with a lot of his other works which feel more chaotic
## Visually
I think the colours and tones really make the most difference here, where Rafaël has chosen to use more pastel-like, **less saturated colours**.   
It's a lot less visually jarring to look at statically when the colors are more **absorbable** like this. The colors being in gradients i think makes a lot of sense as well, to further distance the simulation from a sense of unease. It allows each colour to **blend gently** with the colours preceding it.

Another point to note is the **speed** at which the gradients grow into each other, and the **frequency** that new gradients are made.  
Each gradient flows smoothly across the screen, mimicking ripples on water. They have enough time to spread almost completely across the screen before another gradient takes their place, which feels natural to look at.

# Sonically
Sound can be an **oppressive force** in a piece of art, or complimentarily gentle. In this piece, there is **no sound** at all.
I think this silence can be seen as a functionally 'cute' aspect of the sketch. There's nothing for my ears to focus on, which can be interpreted as the lack of such an oppressive force for my senses to process. You can always close your eyes and look away, but there is no such parallel for our sense of hearing and our ears, meaning that when we are presented with a sound, we have little agency on our senses experiencing it. 

This sketch *relinquishes its control over what we hear,* which helps keep our attention on the visuals of the sketch, as well as implying the **absence of control** over the environment's sound.

# Interactivity
This sketch offers **no interaction**, or at least none that appeared in my testing. In a vacuum, this tells me that the piece is not expecting us to do anything, implying that it has full agency. But in the context of this sketch, it's more of a **gentle** reminder that *we don't have to do anything* for this sketch. We can just relax looking at it without needing to do *anything at all* to influence it. Control in the case of the former can be interpreted as *a force of authority*, where this piece uses it to represent the absolute **absence of authority**, that there is nothing we **have to do** (rather than nothing we *can* do), which allows us to just experience the artwork **passively**, and tells us to focus on every other active element of the sketch.
