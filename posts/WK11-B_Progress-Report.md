# Progress Report
The project's moving well. I've finished the mockup UI in Figma and set up the framework to bring assets into Javascript using D3.js and SVG Exports. Data out from Forza is connected, now it's just about wiring it to the visuals.

Each part of the final project adds to the whole, and building the UI took some unexpected routed. The UI will be the *Fruiting Body* of this creative project.

While i'm working on my project's function and form, i'm engaging with the Forza Horizon tuning community as the Community of Practice.
To reiterate and build on from a previous post:
Domain: Performance tuning
Repertoire: Shared setups, Tuning guides
Values: Precision, feedback, experimentation
Brokering: I bridge their meta knowledge with visual tools

Overall the design and dev are feeding into and building off each other's progress
