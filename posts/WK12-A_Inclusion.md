# Inclusion as a core pillar of Creative Coding
Inclusion is absolutely neccesary as a structual pillar of Creative Coding. Without it, the field risks replicating the same exclusions seen in traditional tech spaces. Access to digital infrastructure and the capacity to generate technology are still unevenly distributed, often limiting who gets to participate creatively.

Computer science gatekeeping and narrow educational pipelines ignore diverse intrinsic motivations for learning. Inclusive creative coding can challenge this by opening up extra institutional hubs of knowledge  where learners aren't constrained by formal credentials.
