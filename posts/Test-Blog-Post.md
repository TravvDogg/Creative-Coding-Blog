# HELOOOOOO
Hi \n
hello?
How do you add new lines to this thing..?  
some online articles say two spaces..  
hey that seemed to work!.. Wonder how obsidian manages it, and if i can fan-dangle a solution based off obsidian's. their solution seems
to
work
with just
the
return
key..?  
definitely not worth it to edit the running file, considering that change might not reflect on everyone's computer. good thought.  
another option might be to either install a plugin that adds two spaces after the end of each line, or rather ensures two spaces exist there... or make one myself?
