Today in class i was asked a question that i've never thought to phrase before.. **What is cute?**  
Well, I can list things that i find cute: Kittens, Puppies, Quokkas, i could go on, but the question still stands. **What is cute?**.

<small> I love quokkas so much. Read more about them [Here](https://wwf.org.au/blogs/8-interesting-facts-about-quokkas/)! </small>
## What Makes these Things Cute?
In a more abstract way of answering the question, i can look at things that i find cute and their attributes. What do they have in common?  
- They are cute because they are **small**
- They are cute because they are **fluffy**
- They are cute because they are **energetic**
Well, you get the point. But we can go one step further: **What is similar in these attributes?**  
  
Well, they can all be pooled into a similar place on the **Aesthetic Register**
## What's an 'Aesthetic Register?'  
In its essence, an Aesthetic Register measures an object's ability to make someone **feel** something based on where it sits on a 'scale' of sorts. 
It's easy to think of it with a visual example.  
Look at these two drawings
![Eye comparison](Wk-2A/Cute-Vengeful-Eyes.png)
Its pretty easy to choose one that looks cuter to you, but why?
the cat, with its big eyes is **rounder** and **softer**. it's head is out of proportion with its body, and its eyes out of proportion with its head.  
On the other hand, the sketch of the eye on the right almost feels **hateful**, or at the very least **aggressive**, and we feel this way about the eye because of its sharp corners, tight appearance and inward slant.  
They are both, undoubtably eyes, but they make us feel different based on **their Properties**.

These **Properties** represent different weights on the **Aesthetic Register**, and the presence or definition of these properties influence our perception and emotions as we experience something.  

These weights on a register are not absolute however, and each person might experience them differently from someone else, based on their biases and expectations.

## How can i use this 'Register' in my P5.js Sketches?
