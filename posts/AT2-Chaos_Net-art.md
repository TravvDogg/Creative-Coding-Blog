# My Net-Art: Music Visualiser
<iframe

Creating this visualiser was a lot of fun, and there is still a lot i can do with it, given the time to progress further, but i'm more than happy to submit it in the current state, as it demonstrates my idea pretty well.

Getting this to render in the markdown file took quite a bit more time than i'd happily admit, but in the end the solution was much simpler than anything i was trying to do - Just wrap it in an iframe and call it a day. Do mind that it does look different from fullscreen and i did apply bandaids to the code where it rendered differently than intended. My uploaded github repo does not include these bandaids.

# my process
Earlier i mentioned that i had a lot of fun making this piece, but when i say this piece, i really mean everything that led to it. 

What you see in the final piece is the set of individual parts that made it to the final submission, but what you dont see are the many precursors to them
